# Udacity-Project3 Fill in the Blanks python game. 
System specs- Python 2.7.13, Windows 7 64bit
IDEs- Sublime and Eclipse
Tested with Windows command line
# Issues: 
-The strings were cutoff when testing the code output in Eclipse and GitBash. It would only display properly with Windows Command line. I could not find a resolution besides using the "textwrap" module for python which would add time and complexity to the project.
